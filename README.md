# BeThere
## 'Coming Together is a beginning; keeping together is progress; working together is success' -Henry Ford

## Description: 
BeThere is a dedicated volunteerism application focused on bringing together businesses and universities with the communities around them and the organizations that need their help. We set out to create an application that provides a clean, simple UI where people can find ways of giving back in their community. We ensure that our application is free of advertisements and unverified posts by partnering with volunteer groups and programs to ensure that users can feel assured that when they sign up for an event or opportunity, that they are truly making a difference within their community.

## Installation:
We utilized axios, express, passport, mongo and mongoose as well as heroku for deployment. To utilize the app, no installation is necessary.
## Instructions:
Beginning with login/signup users provide protected information which is solely utilized by our team to provide volunteer information to the projects they volunteer for. Upon login the user is presented with a feed of recent postings as well as a search or post option for volunteer opportunities. Users can sign up for or post their community volunteer opportunities.
